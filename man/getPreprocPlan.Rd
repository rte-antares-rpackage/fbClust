\title{Generate a data.table with the ptdf}
\usage{
getPreprocPlan(path_ptdf_matrix_factor = "PtdfMatrixFactors.csv",
  path_ptdf_matrix_constraint = "PtdfMatrixConstraints.csv")
}
\arguments{
\item{path_ptdf_matrix_factor}{path of the file containing the ptdf of the
flowbased structure
\itemize{
 \item SESSION_ID : The Date, in numeric format : YYYYMMDD
 \item MATRIX_ID : The Period (hour in the day), between 1 and 24
 \item ROW_ID : The id of the row
 \item REMAININGAVAILABLEMARGIN : The constraint (or ram)
}}

\item{path_ptdf_matrix_constraint}{path of the file containing the constraints of 
the flowbased structure (the ram). Its columns have to be :
\itemize{
 \item SESSION_ID : The Date, in numeric format : YYYYMMDD
 \item MATRIX_ID : The Period (hour in the day), between 1 and 24
 \item ROW_ID : The id of the row
 \item BIDDINGAREA_ID : The id of the hub, we must have at least two different
 and they have to be in this selection: (23, 90, 95, 22, 20, 59, 97, 92, 41, 98, 83, 96, 99)
 \item FACTOR : The values of the ptdf by hub
}}
}
\description{
With links to the files PtdfMatrixFactors and PtdfMatrixConstraints,
this function computes a data.table containing all columns needed to keep going
on the procedure to get the distances between polyhedra.
